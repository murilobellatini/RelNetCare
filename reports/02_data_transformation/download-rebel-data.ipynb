       "('Hiranyakashipu (; also known as Hiranyakashyap) was an Asura and king of the \"daityas\" from the Puranic scriptures of Hinduism. His name literally translates to \"clothed in gold\" (\"hiranya\" \"gold\" \"kashipu\" \"soft cushion\"), and is often interpreted as depicting one who is fond of wealth and sensual comforts. In the Puranas, however, it is also stated the name was derived from a golden throne called \\'Hiranyakashipu\\' the asura sat in or nearby during the \"Atiratra\" (Soma) sacrifice. \\n\\nHiranyakashipu\\'s elder brother, Hiranyaksha was slain by Varaha avatar of Lord Vishnu. Angered by this, Hiranyakashipu decided to gain magical powers by performing a penance for Lord Brahma. He is subsequently killed by the Narasimha avatara of Lord Vishnu. His tale depicts the futility of desiring power over others and the strength of God\\'s protection over his fully surrendered devotees (in the case of his son Prahlada).\\nHiranyakashipu, according to legend, earned a boon from Lord Brahma that made him virtually indestructible.\\n\\nThe story of Hiranyakashipu is in three parts. The first has to do with the curse of the Four Kumaras on the gatekeepers of Vaikuntha, Jaya and Vijaya, which causes them to be born as the daityas Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha. The second part deals with Hiranyakashipu\\'s penance to propitiate Brahma and gain a boon from him. The final part deals with his efforts to kill his son Prahlada (a devotee of Vishnu) and his subsequent death at the hands of Narasimha.',\n",

       "   'text': '\"Send Me a Line When I\\'m Across the Ocean\" is a World War I era song first released in 1917. Irving Crocker wrote the lyrics. George L. Cobb composed the music. It was written for both voice and piano. Walter Jacobs of Boston, Massachusetts published the song. The cover was designed by Rose Starmer. On the cover is a watercolor painting of an ocean with ships in the background. In the foreground is an envelope addressed: \"Private Good-boy; Rainbow Division; Somewhere in France.\" \\n\\nThe song is told from the point of view of a soldier leaving for war. He gives instructions to those waiting for him at home: to write to him in order to keep his spirits up. The chorus is as follows: \\n:\"Send me a line when I\\'m across the ocean\"\\n:\"Send me a line to show me your devotion\"\\n:\"A letter nice and long\"\\n:\"As sweet as any song\"\\n:\"To tell me that you\\'ll remember\"\\n:\"Ev\\'ry promise while I\\'m gone\"\\n:\"Write me a word about my dear old mother\"\\n:\"I know I\\'ll miss her more than I can say\"\\n:\"So while I\\'m over the sea\"\\n:\"Just show your love for me\"\\n:\"By sending a line to me each day\" \\n\\nThe sheet music can be found at Pritzker Military Museum & Library.

Its updated version Darkfores2 combines the techniques of its predecessor with Monte Carlo tree search. The MCTS effectively takes tree search methods commonly seen in computer chess programs and randomizes them. With the update, the system is known as Darkfmcts3.\\n\\nDarkforest is of similar strength to programs like CrazyStone and Zen. It has been tested against a professional human player at the 2016 UEC cup. Google\\'s AlphaGo program won against a professional player in October 2015 using a similar combination of techniques.\\n\\nDarkforest is named after Liu Cixin\\'s science fiction novel \"The Dark Forest\".',\n",

The only survivor of a large family of brothers and sisters is Daniel Hand, well known for his recent gift to the American Missionary Association.\\n\\nHe graduated from Yale College in 1829. After teaching for a short time in Connecticut, he went to Detroit, Michigan, where he studied law and was admitted to practice. He was soon recognized as a lawyer of ability and promise, and in 1835 he was appointed Judge of Probate for the county. In 1846 he was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives. Under President Pierce he held the office of U. S. District Attorney for the district of Michigan. In later life he relinquished active practice, and was occupied with the care of his large property in real estate —until symptoms of softening of the brain appeared about 1884. In 1885 he was taken to his early home in Madison, where he died on August 30, 1889, at the age of 80. He was never married.',\n",

It is planned to operate 24/7 on a north–south corridor along the East River between the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.\\n\\nThe BQX was initially proposed in 1989 as part of a Brooklyn waterfront streetcar line connecting Red Hook with Downtown Brooklyn. A study by the city, published in 2011, found the proposal to be infeasible. A later proposal by the nonprofit Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector, made public in January 2016, found backing from Mayor Bill de Blasio. A director for Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector was appointed in May 2016, and a list of possible routings was released in November 2016. However, there has been criticism of the project, namely that its completion date of mid-2020s may make it obsolete; that it does not have a clear source for funding; and that it is a poor substitute for subway service.',\n",

It was built in 1930-31 and was designed by Mortimer Dickerson Metcalfe – the Deputy State Architect under Franklin B. Ware. Metcalfe used the Neoclassical style for the building, which is one of only two courthouses in the city he designed. The limestone-facaded building with Ionic columns has separate facades and entrances for the Municipal Court, on 42nd Street, and the Magistrates Court, on 43rd Street. The two facades are almost identical.\\n\\nThe building, which is one of only a handful of historic buildings remaining in the neighborhood, was converted for non-court use in 1962. \\n\\nIn 1970 it was the location of the New York City Job Preparation Center, and Community Board 7 also moved into the building at about this time. By 1973 the Sunset Park Senior Citizens Center and other non-profit agencies were located there. A full renovation of the building was completed by Helpern Artitects in 1996, and the New York Police Department moved into the building shortly afterwards, to use as its primary processing center for applicants.\\n\\nThe building was designated a New York City Landmark in 2001.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Adventures of Mana is an action role-playing video game developed by MCF and Square Enix, and published by Square Enix. It is a 3D remake of the 1991 Game Boy game \"Final Fantasy Adventure\", the first game in the \"Mana\" series. It was released worldwide for Android and iOS on February 4, 2016; a PlayStation Vita version was also released on the same date in Japan, and in June 2016 in North America, South America and Europe. In addition to these releases, Square Enix has said that they are considering developing versions for PlayStation 4 and personal computers.\\n\\nThe player takes the role of a young hero who, together with a heroine, tries to stop the Dark Lord of Glaive from destroying the Tree of Mana. The gameplay focuses on combat with monsters or other enemies, and is seen from a top-down perspective. The player traverses the game world, which is divided into several areas, and makes their way through dungeons. While fighting monster characters, a gauge is shown on the screen filling up over time and resetting when the player gets hit or attacks; by waiting to attack until the gauge is full, the player can use a stronger attack. The player is accompanied by various non-player characters, who each have different skills the player can use, and who help them defeat enemies.\\n\\nThe idea for the game came from the producer, Masaru Oyamada, who wanted all \"Mana\" games to be playable on modern platforms for the series\\' 25th anniversary in 2016. Initially there was some argument at Square Enix about whether the remake should be done in 2D or 3D; they chose 3D, as it was thought to be easier to control on smartphones and because it could be used as a base for potential future \"Mana\" remakes. The game has received positive reviews, with reviewers giving particular praise to the visuals and the music.',\n",
